      <description>Brick is a uniform schema for representing metadata in buildings. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and relationships among them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of diverse buildings across different campuses, each comprising thousands of data points, and running complex unmodified applications on these buildings.
Brick Concepts Our research paper describes the Brick design and development in depth (link to paper).</description>
