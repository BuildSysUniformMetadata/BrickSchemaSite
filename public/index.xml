      <description>Brick Downloads Brick consists of several TTL (&amp;ldquo;Turtle&amp;rdquo;) files. Latest version (v1.0.2) available here:
 Brick.ttl: Brick classes and tagsets BrickFrame.ttl: Brick relationships BrickTag.ttl: Brick tags (internal) BrickUse.ttl: Brick uses relationships (internal)  Past releases are available on GitHub

 Brick TTL files Example Buildings Example Applications  Brick is created from collective efforts.
Process The Brick schema files were generated by:
 Identifying necessary terminologies from existing building metadata and modern applications. The result is the Building application list. Organizing the terminologies into Tags/Tagsets in a spreadsheet. The result is the Schema Engineering Sheet Converting the spreadsheet into Turtle files.</description>

      <description>Brick is a uniform schema for representing metadata in buildings. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and relationships among them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of diverse buildings across different campuses, each comprising thousands of data points, and running complex unmodified applications on these buildings.
Brick Concepts Our research paper describes the Brick design and development in depth (link to paper).</description>

      <description>You can run the tutorial yourself using the IPython Notebook!
Tutorial We&amp;rsquo;re running a tutorial at BuildSys 2017!
A unified metadata schema has an important role in building operation and application interoperability. Brick is a unified metadata schema born from a BuildSys communityâ€™s effort on advancing technologies for the built environment. We propose a tutorial session for BuildSys attendants to learn about how to use Brick in their real systems and promote more involvement in Brick development.</description>

      <description> Schema Files (Turtle format)  Brick TagSets: Entity classes with a hierarchy. Major component of Brick.  E.g., Temperature_Sensor is a subclass of Sensor  Brick Relationships: Brick relationships and meta-structure constructing TagSets with Tags.  E.g., sensor1 is a point of vav1.  Brick Tags: Tags are subcomponents of all TagSets.  E.g., Temperature_Sensor consists of Tempearture and Sensor.  Brick Dimensions: Information dimensions of TagSets.  </description>

      <description>A Uniform Metadata Schema for Buildings Commercial buildings have long since been a primary target for applications from a number of areas: from cyber-physical systems to building energy use to improved human interactions in built environments. While technological advances have been made in these areas, such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema reducing the now-prohibitive cost of porting these applications and systems to different buildings.</description>
