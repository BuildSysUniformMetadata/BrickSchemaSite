## What is Alabaster?

[Alabaster](https://github.com/bitprophet/alabaster) was originally a theme for the popular documentation tool [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/). This theme port to Hugo theme is all about documentations. It should allow you to easily create a documentation for your projects.

[Fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/) and [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) are two examples of the Alabaster theme in the wild.

The following pages will guide you through the setup, introduce you to the very basics of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and show you the capabilities of this theme. Have a look at the [Roadmap]({{< relref "roadmap/index.md" >}}) if you're curious about what comes next.

## Acknowledgements

Last but not I want to give a big shout-out to [Jeff Forcier](https://github.com/bitprophet), [Kenneth Reitz](https://github.com/kennethreitz) and [Armin Ronacher](https://github.com/mitsuhiko). Their work and modifications on the original codebase made this port possible.

Furthermore, thanks to [Steve Francia](https://gihub.com/spf13) for creating Hugo and the [awesome community](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/graphs/contributors) around the project.
