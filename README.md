# Brick Site

Generation done using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/)

See [here](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) for installing Hugo

To edit, make your markdown changes in the [content](https://github.com/BuildSysUniformMetadata/BrickSchemaSite/tree/master/content)
directory. Each folder is a menu item down the left side of the site, and `index.md` is what gets rendered.

After hugo is installed, run `deploy.sh` from the root of this repo in order to push the site updates

The result should be seen shortly at [http://brickschema.org/](http://brickschema.org/)
