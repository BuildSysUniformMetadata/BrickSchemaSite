`Brick` is created from collective efforts. Brick schema is generated through following steps.

### Processes

1. Identify necessary terminologies from existing building metadata and modern applications.
([Building application list](https://ibm.biz/UCB-IBM-Apps.)).
2. Organize the terminologies into Tags/Tagsets in a spreadsheet.
([Schema Engineering Sheet](https://github.com/BuildSysUniformMetadata/GroundTruth/blob/master/Brick/Schema%20Engineering.xlsx))
3. A script converts the sheet to Turtle files.
([Brick schema generator](https://github.com/BuildSysUniformMetadata/GroundTruth/blob/master/Brick/BuildBrick.ipynb))
4. Generated schema will be shared via [Getting Brick](/source)

### Issue Tracking

We welcome any comments through Github issue page ([Issues](https://github.com/BuildSysUniformMetadata/GroundTruth/issues)). Issues will be reviewed regularly by a board meeting.
In particular, we are pleased to listen to you for missing Tagsets and inaccurate definitions.
