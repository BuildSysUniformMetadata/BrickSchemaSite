`Brick` adheres to the RDF data model ([Resource Description Framework](https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140225/)), which
represents knowledge as a graph expressed as triples: `subject, predicate, object`

Applications and services can query the RDF representation of a building using
SPARQL ([SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-sparql-query/)).

## Brick Concepts
Our research paper describes the Brick design and development in depth ([link to paper](/papers/Brick-BuildSys2016.pdf)). Here we highlight the essential concepts of Brick.

### Tagset
Every entity in the buildings is represented by a Tagset, which is decomposed to multiple Tags.
We model Point, Equipment, Location, and MeasurementProperty as entities in buildings. Each of these are organized into a hierarchy.

![Brick Class Hierarchy]
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BuildSysUniformMetadata/BrickSchemaSite/master/images/class_hierarchy.png)

As an example, *Room Temperature Sensor* is a Tagset that consists of Tags, *Room*, *Temperature*, and *Sensor*. *Room Temperature Sensor* is a subclass of *Temperature Sensor*, which itself is a subclass of *Sensor*. With such a hierarchy, one can find a collection of temperature sensors easily using SPARQL or tag search.
One can also add new Tagsets with Tags if it is not defined in our schema. We encourage you to share your custom Tagsets with us to make `Brick` more comprehensive ([Issues](https://github.com/BuildSysUniformMetadata/GroundTruth/issues)).)


### Tags
Tags represent unit concept in buildings and are decomposed from Tagsets. Tags are used to infer Tagsets' meaning and search without using a query language.
For example, one can easily know *Room Temperature Sensor* is related to *Room*, *Temperature*, and *Sensor* programatically.
This moderates tag-based representation mechanisms to have more coverage.
 

### Relationships
Relationships represent how Brick entities connect with each other.
`Brick` has the following relationships. We constrain the subjects and the objects that relationships can have.

| Relationship  |               Definition              | Subject   | Object |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------------:|:---------:|:------:|
|  hasLocation  |           A is located in B.          |           |Location|
|    controls   | A determines the internal state of B. |           |        |
|    isPartOf   |      A is a component/part of B.      |           |        |
|    hasPoint   | A has a point B that functions for A. | Equipment | Point  |
|     feeds     |      Something flows from A to B.     |           |        |


## Viewing Brick Files

[http://viewer.brickschema.org/](http://viewer.brickschema.org/) has a simple `.ttl` file viewer that allows you to see the structure of Brick building files.
[Here](http://viewer.brickschema.org/static/soda.pdf) is an example output for Soda Hall at UC Berkeley.
