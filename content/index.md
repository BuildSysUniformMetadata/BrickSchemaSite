## A Uniform Metadata Schema for Buildings

Commercial buildings have long since been a primary target for applications
from a number of areas: from cyber-physical systems to building energy use to
improved human interactions in built environments. While technological advances
have been made in these areas, such solutions rarely experience widespread
adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema reducing the
now-prohibitive cost of porting these applications and systems to different
buildings.

`Brick` is an open-source, BSD-licensed development effort to create a uniform
schema for representing metadata in buildings. `Brick` has three
components:

* An RDF class hierarchy describing the various building subsystems and the entities and equipment therein
* A minimal, principled set of relationships for connecting these entities together into a directed graph representing a building
* A method of encapsulation for composing complex components from a set of lower-level ones

Additionally, we have ported five real buildings to the `Brick` schema as examples.

See [Getting Brick](/source) for more information.

Additionally, our paper in [BuildSys 2016](http://buildsys.acm.org/2016/) provides additional detail
